# 🌊 KiFlow AI

**The Intelligent Bridge between Natural Language and KiCad Hardware.**

KiFlow AI is a powerful, AI-driven desktop application and KiCad plugin designed to accelerate electronic design. It transforms text descriptions into fully functional KiCad 8.0 projects, including schematics, initial PCB layouts, and industrial-standard netlists.

## ✨ Features

- **🗣️ Natural Language to Hardware**: Describe your circuit (e.g., "An ESP32 board with USB-C and I2C peripherals") and get a complete project in seconds.
- **🖥️ Premium Desktop UI**: Built with PySide6, featuring real-time log streaming and reasoning token visualization.
- **🧠 Hybrid AI Engine**: Supports OpenAI, OpenRouter (37+ models, including free options), and local LLMs via Ollama.
- **📐 Smart PCB Clustering**: Automatically groups components by connectivity to minimize routing effort.
- **🏭 Industrial Standards**: Exports IPC-D-356 Netlists for factory E-Testing and SPECTRA DSN for Auto-routing.
- **🔌 KiCad Native Integration**: Launch directly from the KiCad PCBNew interface.
